        <h1 class="post-title">Explaining the Pointer Alignment Algorithm</h1>
    
        <p>Pointer alignment is a very simple and important topic but the maths behind it can appear orphic at first glance.</p>

<p>Pointers are integers used to represent locations in memory. At program level, memory is a linear sequence of bytes, often allocated using the <code>malloc()</code> function or the <code>new</code> operator - other, more interesting ways exist to allocate memory on the heap. Despite this discussion being completely language-independent, I will use the C language for the purpose of exemplification.</p>

<p>In a C program, a block of memory of <code>n</code> bytes can be allocated using the statement <code>void * memory_ptr = malloc(n)</code>. This will declare a variable <code>memory_ptr</code> of type "pointer to void" and will initialise it with the return value of the <code>malloc()</code> function, which is, if no error occurs, the pointer to the newly allocated memory. Whatever else we do with that memory is only up to us.</p>

<p>The downside of using <code>malloc()</code> (or in C++ the commonly used default implementations of <code>new</code>) is our program needs to communicate with the kernel to allocate memory, therefore a context switch is required at every call. A program that requires allocating many chunks of memory in bursts and has latency constraints can't rely on such constructs as it would probably be too slow. Example of such programs are video games or high performance servers.</p>

<p>The solution to this is to write custom memory allocators, grab a big chunk of memory from the OS - naively done by calling <code>malloc()</code> - and use the allocators to manage that chunk of memory the same way the OS would but without the requirement of switching context between the application and the kernel every time the application requires some more memory.</p>

<p>One of the problems faced by the allocator is satisfying alignment constraints.</p>

<h2>Alignment constraints</h2>

<p>At machine level, memory is not read byte by byte because busses are wider than a single byte and can be used to transfer more data within the unit of time, speeding up the transfer process.</p>

<p><img src="../../assets/posts/2021/memory-blocks.svg" alt="Memory blocks" />
<em>At machine level, memory is transferred in blocks.</em></p>

<p>Memory controllers require memory locations used for transferring data to be multiple of some specific number to enable fast transfers and when this is not the case, each transfer has to be split into multiple operations in order to move (read or write) the whole piece of information.</p>

<p><img src="../../assets/posts/2021/memory-blocks-multi-reads.svg" alt="Unaligned data distributed across two different blocks" />
<em>Unaligned data may require more than one reads to be retrieved.</em></p>

<p>This makes alignment a first class issue to deal with in allocators and fortunately also a very simple one. Optimised formulas to perform correct alignment though, can appear to be quite convoluted as they use bitwise operations. One such formula is the following:</p>

<pre><code>void *align_address(void * const orig_address, intptr_t const alignment) {
    intptr_t const int_addr = (intptr_t)orig_address;
    intptr_t const mask = alignment - 1;

    return (void *)((int_addr + mask) &amp; ~mask);
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Breaking down the algorithm</h2>

<p>This very simple algorithm takes as inputs a pointer and an integer and returns another pointer. The input pointer is the original, unaligned pointer, the integer is the alignment constraint and the output is the aligned pointer, always greater than or equal to the original pointer.</p>

<p>The alignment constraint must be a power of two for this function to work. Despite this appearing as a huge limitation for the function, memory alignments are always a power of two, turning this into one of the algorithm's strengths as we're going to see.</p>

<p>The algorithm behaves as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Computes the <strong>mask</strong> as the alignment - 1</li>
<li>Computes the sum of the mask and the original pointer</li>
<li>Computes the <em>AND</em> of the sum and the inverse of the mask (masking)</li>
</ul>

<h3>The mask</h3>

<p>The first esoteric term is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10493411/what-is-bit-masking#10493604"><em>mask</em></a>. A mask is a sequence of bits that, coupled with a bitwise operation, defines which bits of the other operand of the bitwise operation are going to be set in the output, effectively <em>masking</em> the input. It's like applying a mask onto a face, where the holes in the mask dictate what bits of the face are going to be visible.</p>

<p>In order to build the mask, we leverage the alignment constraint's property of always being a power of two. Powers of two in binary are always represented by a single 1, with the remainder of the bits all being 0s.</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th class="align-right">Decimal
            <th class="align-right">Binary (8 bits)
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td class="align-right">0
            <td class="align-right">00000000
        <tr>
            <td class="align-right">2
            <td class="align-right">00000010
        <tr>
            <td class="align-right">4
            <td class="align-right">00000100
        <tr>
            <td class="align-right">8
            <td class="align-right">00001000
</table>

<p>The aligned pointer is always going to be equal to or greater than its unaligned version so with the exception of 0 every other aligned pointer will be equal to or greater than the alignment constraint itself:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th class="align-right">Unaligned
            <th class="align-right">Aligned to 16
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td class="align-right">0
            <td class="align-right">0
        <tr>
            <td class="align-right">1
            <td class="align-right">16
        <tr>
            <td class="align-right">16
            <td class="align-right">16
        <tr>
            <td class="align-right">18
            <td class="align-right">32
</table>

<p>We can verify the alignment by dividing the address stored in the pointer by 16 and taking the remainder. When the remainder is 0, the value is a multiple of 16, thus aligned:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>0 mod 16 = 0</code> already aligned</li>
<li><code>1 mod 16 = 1</code> not aligned, needs to be moved 15 (or 16 - 1) bytes ahead</li>
<li><code>16 mod 16 = 0</code> already aligned</li>
<li><code>18 mod 16 = 2</code> not aligned, needs to be moved 14 bytes ahead</li>
<li><code>32 mod 16 = 0</code> aligned</li>
</ul>

<p>Ideally, we could use a more generic formula by adding the value of the alignment constraint minus the result of the modulo operation to the original pointer but this would require <em>division</em>, which is a notoriously slow operation compared to those of the bitwise family - at least on current Intel CPUs.</p>

<p>By subtracting one from the alignment constraint value, we get a mask where the 1s are all the lower part of the address and the 0s are all in the upper part of the address. Were we to mask the original address directly using the negated mask, we would get an address aligned backwards (to the previous multiple of the alignment constraint value).</p>

<pre><code>align(123, 8)
= 123 ∧ ~(8 - 1)
= 0b0111_1011 ∧ ~(0b00001000 - 0b00000001)
= 0b0111_1011 ∧ 0b11111000
= 120

120 mod 8 = 0
</code></pre>

<p>As we can see <code>120 &lt; 123</code> and is 8-bytes aligned. This doesn't work very well in practice, though, as we need the address to be forward-aligned, the equivalent of:</p>

<pre><code>align(123, 8) = (123 ∧ ~(8 - 1)) + 8 = 128
</code></pre>

<p>This would work but how about 0? How about addresses with a value equal to their alignment constraint? They should not change and yet this formula would push them to the next aligned value:</p>

<pre><code>align(128, 8) = (128 ∧ ~(8 - 1)) + 8 = 136
</code></pre>

<p>How to handle these cases?</p>

<h1>The sum of the mask with the original pointer</h1>

<p>We could use an <em>if</em> statement and apply the formula only to non-aligned pointers while returning the already aligned ones verbatim but branching can be quite slow at times so we would prefer to avoid it. It's time to sum the mask to the original pointer.</p>

<p>The first time I encountered this formula I was very puzzled as the explanation for this step was "trust me, it works", plus masks are not meant to be added to values, they're ment for bitwise operations! What could be the black magic behind all that?</p>

<p>Well, after some brain-squeezing and a seemingly pointless hour spent staring at the whiteboard it turned out I was just thinking of addition from the wrong perspective. Instead of thinking in terms of base ten and quantities, we have to view addition as a <em>XOR operator with carry</em>.</p>

<p>XOR works like this:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th class="align-right">A
            <th class="align-right">B
            <th class="align-right">A &#x22bb; B
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td class="align-right">0
            <td class="align-right">0
            <td class="align-right">0
        <tr>
            <td class="align-right">1
            <td class="align-right">0
            <td class="align-right">1
        <tr>
            <td class="align-right">0
            <td class="align-right">1
            <td class="align-right">1
        <tr>
            <td class="align-right">1
            <td class="align-right">1
            <td class="align-right">0
</table>

<p>Addition instead works as follows:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th class="align-right">A
            <th class="align-right">B
            <th class="align-right">A &#x22bb; B
            <th class="align-right">Carry
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td class="align-right">0
            <td class="align-right">0
            <td class="align-right">0
            <td class="align-right">0
        <tr>
            <td class="align-right">1
            <td class="align-right">0
            <td class="align-right">1
            <td class="align-right">0
        <tr>
            <td class="align-right">0
            <td class="align-right">1
            <td class="align-right">1
            <td class="align-right">0
        <tr>
            <td class="align-right">1
            <td class="align-right">1
            <td class="align-right">0
            <td class="align-right">1
</table>

<p>The two tables are the same but addition also produces a carry value of 1 when <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computers-and-internet/xcae6f4a7ff015e7d:digital-information/xcae6f4a7ff015e7d:limitations-of-storing-numbers/a/number-limits-overflow-and-roundoff">overflowing</a>.</p>

<p>By adding the mask, which is all ones in the lower part of the number (lower compared to the location of the single 1 bit in the alignment constraint number), to the original pointer, we're basically ensuring an overflow whenever the lower part of the address is non-zero.</p>

<p>When it's zero, there will be no overflow. The overflow is the carry value of 1 and is added to the upper part of the address. In other words when the lower part is 0 we don't increase the upper part and whenever it's not, we do. Congratulations, we've just implemented an <em>if</em> statement in pure binary maths.</p>

<p>After the addition is done, the lower part is meaningless and must be zeroed out. This is done via masking with an <em>AND</em> operator, using the negation of the mask, effectively discarding all the bits in the lower part of the address. With the whole lower part being 0, we're sure the address is aligned.</p>
